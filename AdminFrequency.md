There are two kind of statistic information that can be viewed:
  * frequency: the number of request being processed at the moment of the view
  * waiting requests: the number of waiting requests - the requests that sleep for a period of time

It is possible to set the frequency / waiting requests value of a backend service to zero with the link 'Reset Fr.' / 'Reset W. req.'. Clicking on the button 'Reset all Frequencies' / 'Reset all Waiting request values' all the frequencies / waiting requests will be set to zero.
The values of the frequency and waiting request can be edited on a different page by clicking on the link 'Update'.

It is important to mention that a new backend service cannot be added and an existing one cannot be removed.
