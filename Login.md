You have to log in to the web application before using it.
The Apache Shiro framework (http://shiro.apache.org/) is used for authentication. By using Apache Shiro it is very easy to connect to LDAP, database or other store to execute the authentication. It is easy to configure, for more information please have a look at the web site.

If the default shiro configuration is used then the username is 'administrator' and the password is 'throttling'. The user has the 'Administrator' role in this case.
